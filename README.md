# Key Principles of C Programming

C is a powerful, procedural programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972. It is known for its performance, portability, and low-level memory access, making it ideal for **system-level programming**.

## What is System-Level Programming?

**System-level programming** involves writing software that interacts directly with the hardware and core operating system components. Unlike high-level programming that focuses on user applications, system-level programming deals with:

- **Operating systems**: Managing system resources like memory, processes, and file systems.
- **Device drivers**: Software that controls hardware components, such as printers, keyboards, and network devices.
- **Embedded systems**: Programming for devices with dedicated functions, such as routers, washing machines, or microcontrollers.

# Why is C used for System-Level Programming?

C's ability to manipulate memory directly, its minimal runtime, and its efficient execution make it well-suited for system-level programming.
